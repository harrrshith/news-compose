# news-compose
A simple news application which fetches news from `newsapi.org`.
This is a project through which I learnt jetpack compose.

### This sample app showcases the following:

* MVVM Architecture (ViewModel + MutableState + Flow)
* Dagger Hilt for DI
* Compose ConstraintLayout
* Compose TopBar
* Using Newsapi.org API as a data source
